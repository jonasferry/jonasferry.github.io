<h1>FERRYHACK ARS MAGICA MAGIC RULES<h1>

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<pre>
Ferryhack started in October 2013 as a combination of rules from <a class="external" href="https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/">WHITEHACK</a> and written adventures from <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakar_och_Demoner">DRAKAR OCH DEMONER</a>. The first adventure saw two players crawl through The Pyramid of the Spider King (Spindelkonungens pyramid), and has been followed by many old-school Drakar adventures in a bi-weekly campaign. The name Ferryhack is used by the players to refer to my (Jonas Ferry) propensity to add, modify, and remove rules from Whitehack. We started with Whitehack 1, but have moved on to a house-ruled version of Whitehack 2.

In addition to rules from Whitehack 2 (2015) and Drakar och Demoner 2.1 (1985), the main inspiration is Moldvay's <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">BASIC DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS</a> (1981). The magic rules in this document is inspired by Ars Magica 5.

This text describes the magic rules used mainly during the adventures BLACK DUEL (Svart duell, 1986) and THE BEAUTY AND THE BEASTS (Skönheten och odjuren, 1986). At the start of DEAD FOREST (Döda skogen, 1985), the group returned to a magic system inspired by Drakar och Demoner 2.1, described in <a class="external" href="http://jonasferry.com/ferryhack.htm">FERRYHACK</a> and <a class="external" href="http://jonasferry.com/ferryhack_grid.htm">GRID</a>.

<h1>HOUSE RULES</h1>
<pre>
Each magic-user (Wise PCs and certain monsters) has Magic Points (MP) equal to HD, rolled and improved separately.

Items marked with an asterisk is the default level for that category. A combination of all marked levels costs 1 MP.

Unwilling targets get to save vs magic. Targets Individual, Part of creature, or Group save to get no effect. Targets Circle, Part other than creature, Room, Structure, and Boundary save to get half effect. This sets up a nice tactical choice between putting individual enemies on fire or putting the room on fire. In the former case they save vs full effect, in the latter case vs half effect, but allies can also be hit.
