<h1>FERRYHACK GRID RULES</h1>

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<pre>
Ferryhack started in October 2013 as a combination of rules from <a class="external" href="https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/">WHITEHACK</a> and written adventures from <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakar_och_Demoner">DRAKAR OCH DEMONER</a>. The first adventure saw two players crawl through The Pyramid of the Spider King (Spindelkonungens pyramid), and has been followed by many old-school Drakar adventures in a bi-weekly campaign. The name Ferryhack is used by the players to refer to my (Jonas Ferry) propensity to add, modify, and remove rules from Whitehack. We started with Whitehack 1, but have moved on to a house-ruled version of Whitehack 2.

In addition to rules from Whitehack 2 (2015) and Drakar och Demoner 2.1 (1985), the main inspiration is Moldvay's <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">BASIC DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS</a> (1981).

This text describes the grid rules used mainly during the adventures DEAD FOREST (Döda skogen, 1985), GATES OF POWER (Maktens portar, 1985), and HEART OF DARKNESS (Mörkrets hjärta, 1986). At the start of VOICE FROM THE PAST (Rösten från forntiden, 1986), the group returned to the theater of mind, described in <a class="external" href="http://jonasferry.com/ferryhack.htm">FERRYHACK</a>.

<h2 id="ARMOR">ARMOR</h2>
<pre>
Armor does not take up slots when worn, only when carried. Some monsters wear armor (e.g. orcs wear studded leather or leather and shield), some monsters wear armor in addition to natural armor (e.g. one type of ogre may have natural armor 0 and chainmail while another have natural armor 2 and leather), and some monster only have natural armor (e.g. wolves). The sum of natural armor and worn armor is found in Whitehack's monster table.

* To run in full plate, roll STR. Success means second move action is used, failure means PC cannot move at all next round.
</pre>

<h2 id="DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT">DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT</h2>
<pre>
By default when a PC or monster is attacked, the defender moves defensively to a square backwards or diagonally backwards. It is considered a part of the defense and does not provoke free attacks from other opponents. By default, the attacker moves to the square that the defender occupied.

The defender can choose to stand their ground, which gives the attacker combat advantage. If a square is occupied by a wall, item, or another character, the defender must move to a free square. If all squares are occupied, the defender may move to a square with an ally if the ally makes a defensive movement of their own. If all squares are occupied with non-allies, the defender must stand their ground and give the attacker combat advantage.

Combat advantage from standing ground is added to combat advantage from flanking. The squares are the same as for FLANK.

The attacker can choose to not follow the defender by using the special combat option Fight Defensively from Whitehack. This makes it possible to disengage and use the second movement action for full movement.

The special combat option Trick (Push) and the Strong melee option 2 (Push) take effect after the defender's movement and the attacker's follow-up move.

The diagrams show an attacker (a) that attacks a defender (d), and the squares that the defender can move to (x).

<h2 id="DISENGAGE">DISENGAGE</h2>
<pre>
To disengage from combat, one action is used to defend and one action is used to move carefully away from the opponent. An unecumbered human moves 3 squares when disengaging. Disengaging does not provoke a free attack.
</pre>

<h2 id="ENCUMBRANCE">ENCUMBRANCE</h2>
<pre>
Equipment is carried in slots divided between body, backpack, and sack. One slot is equal to 1 BEP or 2-3 kg. 200 small items (e.g. coins, rings, jewels) use one slot. Normal sized items (e.g. swords, shields) use one slot. A quiver with 20 items of ammunition (e.g. quiver with arrows, bolts, sling stones) use one slot. Large items (e.g. two-handed swords, halberds) use two slots.

The body carries 5 slots. A one-handed weapon use 1 slot, a shield 1 slot, and a two-handed weapon 2 slots. Worn armor does not use any slots. Used body slots do not affect movement.

A small backpack carries 5 slots while a large backpack carries 10 slots. Any slots used in a small backpack reduce movement by 1 square. Any slots used in a large backpack reduce movement by 2 squares.

A sack carries 5 slots. Any slots used in a sack reduce movement by 1 square.

STR 13+ gives an extra slot of each type and STR 16+ gives two extra slots.

<h2 id="FLANK">FLANK</h2>
<pre>
The attacker gets combat advantage if an ally is placed behind or diagonally behind the defender. 

Combat advantage from flanking is added to combat advantage from standing ground. The squares are the same as for DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT.

The diagrams show an attacker (a) that attacks a defender (d), and the squares where an ally must stand to give the attacker combat advantage.

<h2 id="FREE ATTACK">FREE ATTACK</h2>
<pre>
PCs and monsters guard their surrounding eight squares. If an opponent leaves a guarded square, the guard gets a free attack. Characters with more than one free attack (e.g. Strong) may attack once for each guarded square that is left, a number of times equal to the character's level.

The only thing that provokes a free attack is to move away from a guarded square. Readying a potion, quaffing a potion, or preparing a spell does not provoke a free attack.

The diagram shows a guard (g) and the eight guarded squares (x).

<h2 id="HORSE">HORSE</h2>
<pre>
Pack animals have three encumbrance levels, with a number of slots according to class, e.g. mule=20. Master bred animals (cost x 20) get death saves at 5+HD. A normal human take up 40 slots. 1 slot = 1 BEP = 2-3 kg.

</pre>

<h2 id="MOVEMENT">MOVEMENT</h2>
<pre>
Each PC and monster can use one or two actions for movement each combat round. Moving carefully (e.g. disengage from combat or sneak) means movement per action is halved. Walking or running doesn't affect the movement per action, it all depends on if the character use one or two actions for movement. Wearing full plate armor means that the second movement action (after modification) is halved.
<b>
Species  Move(sq)</b>
Giant       8
Human       6
Elf         6
Dwarf       4
Halfling    4
Goblin      4
</pre>

<h2 id="SPELLS">SPELLS</h2>
<pre>
Spellcasters learn spells by assigning them to active or inactive slots. It takes 12 hours to switch an inactive spell into an active slot. Spellcasting monsters have HD number of active spells and an equal number of inactive.

Spells have a minimum level for PCs or a minimum HD for monsters to learn the spell. A spellcaster can cast spells of a spell level equal to or lower than their level.  

Spells take a full round of concentration to prepare where the spellcaster cannot do anything else. When the spell is prepared, the spell and spell level (SL) must be stated, but the target is decided when the spell takes effect. The spell takes effect immediately before the spellcaster's next round, so they can use the next round to prepare a new spell.

Successful spells and critical failures cost 1 MP per SL. Failed spells cost 1 MP regardless of SL. Aborted spells do not cost any MP.

A PC spellcaster's chance of success is based on their save vs magic, with +2 for all wise characters. WIS 13+ gives +1 and WIS 16+ gives +2.

Caster  WIS  WIS  WIS
level   12-  13+  16+
  1      8    9   10
  2      9   10   11
  3     10   11   12

  9     16   17   18
 10     17   18   19

A monster spellcaster's chance of success is 5+HD and their MP is 10+HD, with +1 chance of success at HD 3 and +2 at HD 6.

As long as a spellcaster concentrates on an active spell they can not do anything else, not even move or speak.

The spells are presented with the Swedish name in parenthesis.

Adding spell descriptions is work in progress.

A spell that is being prepared can be dispelled, if the SL is equal or higher than the spell to destroy.
</pre>

<h3>Armor (SKYDD), range 80 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn</h3>

<h3>Protector (BESKYDDARE), range touch, duration permanent</h3>
<pre>
Nine stones are placed on the ground to protect a volume of 2x2x2 squares. Each extra SL adds the length of 2 squares in one direction.

Any spell saved by Anti Magic (ANTIMAGI) triggers an Energy Beam (ENERGISTRÅLE) that targets the spellcaster.
</pre>

<h3>Summon/Banish Elemental (FRAMMANA/SKICKA BORT ELEMENTAR), range 8 squares, duration 10 combat rounds</h3>
<pre>
Summons a human-sized air, fire, earth, or water elemental of 1 HD per SL from an existing instance of that element within range. When summoned in combat, the elemental gets the same intiative as the spellcaster. The spellcaster concentrates to move the elemental, otherwise the elemental stands still.

To banish an elemental, the spellcaster casts an equal or higher SL as the elemental's HD. The elemental rolls save vs magic with 10+HD. Each extra SL of Banish Elemental (SKICKA BORT ELEMENTAR) above HD gives -1 to the save.

<pre>
1.5 x 1.5 meter squares are used in dungeon maps. Movement and ranges are described in squares.
</pre>

<h2 id="XP">XP</h2>
<pre>
XP for treasure is collected when treasure is spent. Treasure is divided between the PCs by the players. If an NPC helps the PCs find the treasure, the referee negotiates for their share of treasure. Only valuables (e.g. coins, jewels) and art objects (e.g. jewelry, paintings) are treasure. Utility articles (e.g. weapons, tools) are not treasure and do not give XP.

- Treasure spent to acquire equipment gives XP to current PC.
- Treasure donated (e.g. by partying, giving to the poor, offering to religion) gives XP to current and next PC.
- Treasure in the form of magic items donated to NPCs give XP to next PC as 1/10 of their resale value.

1 silver piece = 1 XP.

XP for defeated monsters (not necessarily killed) is divided between the PCs by the players. If an NPC helps the PCs in the fight, the referee negotiates for their share of XP.

XP for written adventures are handed out when the PCs have explored a specificed part of the adventure. The referee decided on how many XP the complete adventure is worth based on length and difficulty, and divides them between different parts of the adventure. In a five level dungeon, the PCs may get 500 XP after each level explored. In a five checkpoint linear adventure, the PCs may get 500 XP at each checkpoint. Adventure XP is individual, and is not divided between multiple characters. The player must be present for their PC to get adventure XP.
