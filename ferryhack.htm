OVERVIEW
Ferryhack started in October 2013 as a combination of rules from <a href="https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/">Whitehack</a> and written adventures from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakar_och_Demoner">Drakar och Demoner</a>. The first adventure saw two players crawl through The Pyramid of the Spider King (Spindelkonungens pyramid), and has been followed by many old-school Drakar adventures in a bi-weekly campaign. The name Ferryhack is used by the players to refer to my (Jonas Ferry) propensity to add, modify, and remove rules from Whitehack. We started with Whitehack 1, but have moved on to a house-ruled version of Whitehack 2.

In addition to rules from Whitehack 2 (2015) and Drakar och Demoner 3 (1985), the main inspiration is Moldvay's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic Dungeons and Dragons</a> (1981).

ACTION COMPLEXITY
Works the same as armor class, but describes task difficulty.

ANALYZE MAGIC ITEM
Magic items must be analyzed by the spell Sight (SYN) to know which spells are bound and how to activate the bound spells.

ARMOR
Armor does not take up slots when worn, only when carried. Some monsters wear armor (e.g. orcs wear studded leather or leather and shield), some monsters wear armor in addition to natural armor (e.g. one type of ogre may have natural armor 0 and chainmail while another have natural armor 2 and leather), and some monster only have natural armor (e.g. wolves). The sum of natural armor and worn armor is found in Whitehack's monster table.

(run x1.5)

ATTRIBUTES
When creating a PC, roll 3d6 in order. If wanted, swap two values.

BASH CHEST
Bashing a locked chest takes a dungeon turn. It is autmatically successful if some kind of weapon or tool is used, but makes a lot of noise. Fragile objects (e.g. glass or ceramics) in bashed chests are destroyed.

BASH DOOR
Bashing a locked or stuck door takes a dungeon turn. It is autmatically successful if some kind of weapon or tool is used, but makes a lot of noise.

BUY MAGIC ITEM
Unless the adventure states it, it's not possible to buy magical items. If they can be bought, the price is (2^SL)*1000 gp. SL is in this case the sum of all spell levels in the item.

COMBAT ROUND
A combat round is approximately 5 seconds. A full fight takes a dungeon turn, regardless of how many combat rounds passed. This is important for the duration of torches and magical spell effects.

CREATE MAGIC ITEM
Magic items are found in written adventures and cannot be created by PCs.

A magic spell is bound in the item by casting the spell together with the spell Sigil (SIGILL). This is enough for a one-use item that draws MP from the user. To make the item multiple-use, the spell Permanence (PERMANENS) is cast. To give the item its own set of MP, the spell Charge (LADDNING) is used. To make the item draw MP from the environment, the spell Nexus (NEXUS) is used.

CRITICAL FAILURE
Roll 1d6:
1  Weapon, normal or magic, breaks. *
2  Armor, normal or magic, breaks. *
3  Attacker hits themselves.
4  Attacker hits closest ally.
5  Drops weapon out of reach.
6  Dazed for 2 rounds.
* If successful master crafted item save, item is broken rest of adventure.	

CRITICAL HIT
A critical hit in a fight is when the roll including modifiers equal AV. Damage is rolled twice, including modifiers, and added together. When a Deft PC rolls double damage they also roll damage twice and add together. If a Deft PC rolls a critical hit, they roll damage three times and add together.

CRITICAL WOUND
A critical wound is when a PC is brought to 0 HP. The PC's condition is stable for the PC's current level number of turns, but after that must roll save vs death each round. To stop this process a successful first aid roll must be performed. When stabilized, the PC is knocked out until they reach positive HP.

DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT
By default when a PC or monster is attacked, the defender moves defensively to a square backwards or diagonally backwards. It is considered a part of the defense and does not provoke free attacks from other opponents. By default, the attacker moves to the square that the defender occupied.

The defender can choose to stand their ground, which gives the attacker combat advantage. If a square is occupied by a wall, item, or another character, the defender must move to a free square. If all squares are occupied, the defender may move to a square with an ally if the ally makes a defensive movement of their own. If all squares are occupied with non-allies, the defender must stand their ground and give the attacker combat advantage.

Combat advantage from standing ground is added to combat advantage from flanking. The squares are the same as for FLANK.

The attacker can choose to not follow the defender by using the special combat option Fight Defensively from Whitehack. This makes it possible to disengage and use the second movement action for full movement.

The special combat option Trick (Push) and the Strong melee option 2 (Push) take effect after the defender's movement and the attacker's follow-up move.

The diagrams show an attacker (a) that attacks a defender (d), and the squares that the defender can move to (x).

DISENGAGE
To disengage from combat, one action is used to defend and one action is used to move carefully away from the opponent. An unecumbered human moves 3 squares when disengaging. Disengaging does not provoke a free attack.

DUNGEON TURN
A dungeon turn is 10 minutes.

ELVEN ROPE
Elven rope takes up one slot instead of two for regular rope. They don't generally break, gives +2 DEX to climb in moonlight and any orcs and goblins have AC 2 to escape if tied up with them.

ENCUMBRANCE
Equipment is carried in slots divided between body, backpack, and sack. One slot is equal to 1 BEP or 2-3 kg. 200 small items (e.g. coins, rings, jewels) use one slot. Normal sized items (e.g. swords, shields) use one slot. A quiver with 20 items of ammunition (e.g. quiver with arrows, bolts, sling stones) use one slot. Large items (e.g. two-handed swords, halberds) use two slots.

The body carries 5 slots. A one-handed weapon use 1 slot, a shield 1 slot, and a two-handed weapon 2 slots. Worn armor does not use any slots. Used body slots do not affect movement.

A small backpack carries 5 slots while a large backpack carries 10 slots. Any slots used in a small backpack reduce movement by 1 square. Any slots used in a large backpack reduce movement by 2 squares.

A sack carries 5 slots. Any slots used in a sack reduce movement by 1 square.

STR 13+ gives an extra slot of each type and STR 16+ gives two extra slots.

FIRE
When attacked by fire, roll Xd6 damage: X=1 torch, X=2 campfire, X=varies magic. Any 6 means target is on fire. Spend a whole turn to get a save to put fire out. Items burn! Master crafted items get a save to avoid destruction.

FIRST AID
When performing first aid, roll trained WIS. When using a first aid kit, roll straight WIS. Each first aid attempt takes a dungeon turn.

FLANK
The attacker gets combat advantage if an ally is placed behind or diagonally behind the defender. 

Combat advantage from flanking is added to combat advantage from standing ground. The squares are the same as for DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT.

The diagrams show an attacker (a) that attacks a defender (d), and the squares where an ally must stand to give the attacker combat advantage.

FREE ATTACK
PCs and monsters guard their surrounding eight squares. If an opponent leaves a guarded square, the guard gets a free attack. Characters with more than one free attack (e.g. Strong) may attack once for each guarded square that is left, a number of times equal to the character's level.

The only thing that provokes a free attack is to move away from a guarded square. Readying a potion, quaffing a potion, or preparing a spell does not provoke a free attack.

The diagram shows a guard (g) and the eight guarded squares (x).

GAME STATS ARE OPEN INFORMATION
All game stats are open information, both for PCs and monsters. All dice are rolled in the open. The players may get to know the monsters' HD and AC, but the referee keeps the current monster HPs hidden from the players during the fight.

HEAL
A PC heals their level number of HP in the morning after a full night's rest and again their level number of HP in the evening after a full day's rest. If the rest is interrupted (e.g. keeping watch at night or travelling during the day) or is inadequate in other ways (e.g. sleeping outdoors in the rain without cover) only half HP is healed, rounded down.

HIT POINT
When creating a PC, the first level gets the maximum level 1 HP for the class. When creating a higher level PC, all subsequent HP levels are rolled. If the roll is equal or lower than current HP, increase HP by 1.

HORSE
Pack animals have three encumbrance levels, with a number of slots according to class, e.g. mule=20. Master bred animals (cost x 20) get death saves at 5+HD. A normal human take up 40 slots. 1 slot = 1 BEP = 2-3 kg.

Encumbrance  Move(sq)
First level   Full			
Second level   -2
Third level    -3

Class      HD  Move(sq) Slots  Cost(sp)
Donkey      1    6       15      15

Horse       2   10       25      60
Work horse  3    8       50      90
War horse   3    8       50     120

INITIATIVE
At start of combat, roll 1d6. Group PCs and monsters with same initiative bonus and roll once per group. Break ties between opposing sides by re-rolling and give the winning side +0.5 initative.

Monsters get +1 initative at HD 3 and +2 at HD 6.

MAGIC ARMOR
There are two systems for magic armor. The current system follows the rules for the spell Armor (SKYDD). The old system gives a permanent +1 to +3 to AC.

Magic armor may be destroyed by a critical failure, perhaps because the magic sigil is broken and the spell dissipates or that the stored magic energy runs out.

MAGIC POINT
PCs have the same number of maximum of MP as WIS. Each use of a spell or magic item lowers MP by 1 per SL. A failed spell casting always lowers MP by 1. MP are returned at a rate of 1 per hour at rest and 1 every third hour at activity. Monsters have MP equal to 10+HD. If MP reach 0, the character is dead without a chance to save.

MAGIC POTION
Magic potions can only be found, not bought, unless a written adventure says otherwise. Magic potions have a spell bound in them that is usually activated by quaffing the potion. The potion is usually created with the spell Charge (LADDNING) so that the MP is provided by the potion, not the character.

To ready a potion from a body slot is a minor action. To quaff a readied potion is also a minor action. Readying or quaffing potions do not provoke a free attack.

MAGIC WEAPON
There are two systems for magic weapons. The current system follows the rules for the spell Enchant Weapon (FÖRTROLLA VAPEN). The old system gives a permanent +1 to +3 to AV and damage.

Magic weapons may be destroyed by a critical failure, perhaps because the magic sigil is broken and the spell dissipates or that the stored magic energy runs out.

MASTER CRAFTED ITEM
Master crafted items cost base cost x 20. Master crafted items gets a save when destroyed by a critical failure. Magical items have a 1 in 6 chance of being master crafted.

MORALE
Roll at:
1  First encounter unless outnumbering (optional)
2  First death of side
3  Reduced to half strength (individuals or HP)

Roll 2d6:
≤ M  Stay and fight. Two successful rolls means monster fights to death.
> M  Flee or surrender

Standard morale scores:
6  Normal human
7  Goblin (9 with king) / Halfling
8  Orc / Dwarf / Elf / NPC Party
9  Animal / Veteran human
10 Ogre / Troll
12 Minotaur/Lizardman/Undead

MOVEMENT
Each PC and monster can use one or two actions for movement each combat round. Moving carefully (e.g. disengage from combat or sneak) means movement per action is halved. Walking or running doesn't affect the movement per action, it all depends on if the character use one or two actions for movement. Wearing full plate armor means that the second movement action (after modification) is halved.

Species  Move(sq)
Giant       8
Human       6
Elf         6
Dwarf       4
Halfling    4
Goblin      4

PICK LOCK
When picking a lock, roll trained DEX AC 4. Lock picks are required. Each attempt takes a dungeon turn, and can be attempted multiple times. Critical failure means lock pick is jammed in lock. Harder locks have higher AC.

PLAY PUBLISHED ADVENTURES
When playing a published adventure the players and referee collaborate to experience as much as possible of the adventure, the way it is intended to be played. If a clue is needed to move forward in the adventure the referee provides it either immediately or after a while. The players can still look for more secrets and clues that gives bonuses. The PCs cannot refuse the mission, not kill obviously important non-opposing NPCs in advance, or in other ways make it impossible to finish the mission without heavy modification of the adventure by the referee. When we play non-published adventures anything is allowed!

PLAYERS DECIDE WHEN TO ROLL DICE
The player always decides when to roll dice for their PC. The only dice rolls the referee can request are saving throws for the PC to survive things it couldn't predict, like poison and traps. Even here the player can decide to not roll dice, but then the PC is hit with the negative effect.

PLAYERS KNOW WHY THEY ROLL DICE
A player has a right to know why they roll dice, and possible results if successful or failed. A successful roll gives the player more freedom to determine the result. A failed roll gives the referee more freedom to determine the result.

PUSH DOOR
When pushing a stuck door open, roll STR AC 4. The first attempt takes one action, each extra attempt takes a dungeon turn.

RARE CHARACTER CLASS
When creating a PC, roll 1 in 6 to play a Brave or Fortunate characater.

REACTION
Roll 2d6:
2    Immediate attack
3-5  Hostile, possible attack
6-8  Uncertain, monster confused
9-11 No attack, monster leaves or considers offers
12   Enthusiastic friendship

READ AND WRITE
To read or write texts related to any of the PC's vocation or affiliation groups, roll trained INT. General literacy can be chosen instead of an extra language at INT 13+, which makes the PC literate in all languages they can speak.

RECOGNIZE MAGIC ITEM
To figure out if an item is magical, roll trained INT or WIS AC 4. Groups that give knowledge of magic, history, legends, and so on, are relevant. All magic items have a symbol where the spell is bound, but the symbol can be hidden or hard to recognize. Each recognition attempt take a dungeon turn and can be attempted multiple times.	

SEARCH
When searching for hidden objects or clues, the player may roll INT or WIS AC 8. Each arrempt takes a dungeon turn. On successful roll, referee gives a hint on where to search. Player must always describe where and how the PC searches.

SELL MAGIC ITEM
Magic items cannot be sold for money, but can be traded for utility items or donated to NPCs. The trade or donation value is half the item's purchase cost in gp. Donated magic items give XP to the player's next PC, see entry on XP.

SHIELD
Instead of taking damage from an attack, a PC with a shield can opt to have the shield splintered to avoid all damage. This option is available for both mundane and magic shields, and the decision is made after the amount of damage is known. A splintered shield is broken beyond repair.

SNEAK
When an individual sneaks, roll DEX. This gives the action complexity for observer's WIS roll. When a group sneaks, highest DEX rolls with -1 per extra member.

SPELL BOOK
All spells a spellcaster knows, both active and inactive, are written in a spell book. To cast an inactive spell by reading out loud from the spell book takes a dungeon turn.

When another spellcaster's spell book is studied, a random spell is recognized for each week of study. To actually use the recognized spell it must be learned by assigning it to a slot when levelling up.

SPELLS
Spellcasters learn spells by assigning them to active or inactive slots. It takes 12 hours to switch an inactive spell into an active slot. Spellcasting monsters have HD number of active spells and an equal number of inactive.

Spells have a minimum level for PCs or a minimum HD for monsters to learn the spell. A spellcaster can cast spells of a spell level equal to or lower than their level.  

Spells take a full round of concentration to prepare where the spellcaster cannot do anything else. When the spell is prepared, the spell and spell level (SL) must be stated, but the target is decided when the spell takes effect. The spell takes effect immediately before the spellcaster's next round, so they can use the next round to prepare a new spell.

Successful spells and critical failures cost 1 MP per SL. Failed spells cost 1 MP regardless of SL. Aborted spells do not cost any MP.

A PC spellcaster's chance of success is based on their save vs magic, with +2 for all wise characters. WIS 13+ gives +1 and WIS 16+ gives +2.

Caster  WIS  WIS  WIS
level   12-  13+  16+
  1      8    9   10
  2      9   10   11

  9     16   17   18
 10     17   18   19

A monster spellcaster's chance of success is 5+HD and their MP is 10+HD, with +1 chance of success at HD 3 and +2 at HD 6.

As long as a spellcaster concentrates on an active spell they can not do anything else, not even move or speak.

The spells are presented with the Swedish name in parenthesis.

Adding spell descriptions is work in progress.

Level 1
Mirror Image (AVBILD), range 20 squares, duration 2 dungeon turns
Creates one human-sized illusion per SL. Extra SLs create multiple illusions or one larger illusion. The illusion is only visual, and has no sound, taste, or substance. The illusion can be made to move as long as the spellcaster concentrates.

Fire (ELD), range 80 squares, duration instant
Heats a sphere the size of a square and makes 1d6 damage. Extra SL either gives an extra affected square or +1d6 damage in any combination. Stopped by Armor (SKYDD), but not by Anti Magic (ANTIMAGI). See entry on FIRE for damage and save.

Frost (FROST): See Fire (ELD), but cold. There's no corresponding effect to catching on fire.

Seal (FÖRSEGLA), range touch, duration 2 dungeon turns
Binds together two objects that don't move and fit together, for example a door to the frame or a sword to the scabbard. The objects are impossible to separate for the spell's duration, and any attempts to bash them open (i.e. chests or doors) take an extra dungeon turn. Each extra SL either adds two extra dungeon turns of duration or an extra dungeon turn of durability against bashing.

Light (LJUS), range 80 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn
Makes part of an object (approximately 4x4x4 cm) glow and illuminate 2 squares in each direction. Each extra SL either adds 2 extra squares in each direction or increases duration by 1 dungeon turn. To overcome the spell Darkness (MÖRKER) an equal SL or more of Light (LJUS) is needed.

Resistance (MOTSTÅNDSKRAFT), range touch, duration 2 dungeon turns
Protects from damage from the spells Fire (ELD) and Frost (FROST), as well as normal damage from heat or cold. Decreases 1 HP of damage per SL from those sources. If the user takes damage from multiple sources at the same time, the damage is decreased for each of them.

Darkness (MÖRKER), range 80 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn
Makes part of an object (approximately 4x4x4 cm) consume all light in 2 squares in each direction. Each extra SL either adds 2 extra squares in each direction or increases duration by 1 dungeon turn. To overcome the spell Light (LJUS) an equal SL or more of Darkness (MÖRKER) is needed.

Stone Wall (STENVÄGG), range 8 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn
Pulls up a wall from the dirt or a stone floor that is 1 square thick, 3 squares wide, and 3 squares high. Each extra SL adds the length of a square in one direction.

Level 2
Anti Magic (ANTIMAGI), range 80 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn
Placed on a creature or item and protects a volume of 3x3x3 squares. Gives +1 save vs magic per SL. A spell that is successfully saved is returned at the spellcaster. If cast in conjuction with Armor (SKYDD), the chance of success for Anti Magic (ANTIMAGI) is decreased by 1 per SL Armor (SKYDD).

Lightning (BLIXT), range 40 squares, duration instant, quick
Shoots a lightning bolt from the spellcaster to the closest target in front of the spellcaster. If two targets are equal, it's drawn to the target with most metal. Target gets save vs magic for half damage. This spell is quick, which means it takes effect the same combat round as it is prepared, not the next round.

Energy Beam (ENERGISTRÅLE), range 80 squares, duration instant
A beam of magic energy that does 1d6 damage per SL if it hits the target. Roll to-hit vs target AC, but not save vs magic.

Curse Weapon (FÖRBANNA VAPEN), range 80 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn
Gives a weapon -1 AV and damage per SL. Each extra SL gives an extra -1, which may be divided between multiple weapons.

Enchant Weapon (FÖRTROLLA VAPEN), range 80 squares, duration 1 dungeon turn
Gives a weapon +1 AV and damage per SL. Each extra SL gives an extra +1, which may be divided between multiple weapons. Enchanted weapons damage monsters that only take damage from magic weapons.

Lift (LYFT), range 80 squares, duration 2 dungeon turns
Lifts one human-sized object per SL, and can fly it through the air at a speed of 8 squares per movement action. Can be divided between multiple objects to make them all lighter or break a fall. When breaking a fall, each SL missing from lifting the full objects gives 1d6 damage.

Decrease (MINSKA), range touch, duration 1 dungeon turn
Decrease the target's STR, DEX, or CON by 1 per SL. Attributes cannot be decreased below 1.

Dispel (SKINGRA), range 80 squares, duration instant, quick
Destroys another spell, or banishes an elemental, of equal or lower SL. Dispel (SKINGRA) must target a specific spell, but the spellcaster only needs an approximate idea of what the spell is. If the target is protected by Anti Magic (ANTIMAGI) it gets to save vs magic to avoid destruction. Items get to save with 10+1 per SL Anti Magic (ANTIMAGI).

The following spells from Drakar och Demoner Expert (1985) are used when creating magic items. They are not available to PCs.

Level 5
Charge (LADDNING): ...

Level 6
Permanence (PERMANENS): ...

Sigil (SIGILL): ...

Level 7
Nexus (NEXUS): ...

SQUARE
1.5 x 1.5 meter squares are used in dungeon maps. Movement and ranges are described in squares.

SURPRISE
When surprised in the first round of combat, roll 1d6: 1=one round of no action, 2=two rounds.

TORCH
A torch burns for 6 dungeon turns. Lanterns burn for 24 dungeon turns. Both illuminate 6 squares in all directions unless the lantern is shielded.

TRAP
To find a hidden trap, roll trained WIS AC 4. The speed is 10 squares per dungeon turn. Searching a door or item for traps take one dungeon turn. The referee must decide on the activation mechanism before the roll is made and the player must describe where the PC searches. Most traps admit a save to either avoid activating the trap or avoid the effect of the trap.

USE MAGIC ITEM
To use a magic item it must first be attuned. Attuning a magic item means meditating over or practicing with the item for 12 consecutive hours. A magic item can only be attuned to one person at a time. A person can be attuned to a number of magic items equal to the PC's level or monster's HD.

When the owner of an attuned magic item is killed the magic item is destroyed. If the magic item is master crafted, the owner saves to keep the item in this world. Found magic items have a 1 in 6 chance of being master crafted.

Magic items have different activation methods. The most common activation methods are minor actions: a phrase that must be uttered, putting the item on (e.g. a ring or necklace), touch the item with a specific substance, and so on. If the activation method is not mentioned in a written adventure it is assumed to be an activation phrase.

If the correct activation method is used a magic item always works. Unless it has been created with the spell Charge (LADDNING) or Nexus (NEXUS) it draws its energy from the character's MP. A magic item always uses the maximum spell level, so a Heal (HELA) SL 4 item will always cost 4 MP.

Magic armor and weapons can be destroyed if an attack is a critical failure. For other magic items, roll 1d20 and 1d6 when they are activated: Result 20 and 1 means that the owner must make a successful save or the item is destroyed. Master crafted magic items get another save to avoid being destroyed.

WEATHER
Roll 2d6:
2   Cold rain or snow
3   Cold clouds and windy
4   Cold and clear
5-9 Normal for season
10  Warm and clear
11  Warm clouds and windy
12  Warm rain or thunder

XP
XP for treasure is collected when treasure is spent. Treasure is divided between the PCs by the players. If an NPC helps the PCs find the treasure, the referee negotiates for their share of treasure. Only valuables (e.g. coins, jewels) and art objects (e.g. jewelry, paintings) are treasure. Utility articles (e.g. weapons, tools) are not treasure and do not give XP.

- Treasure spent to acquire equipment gives XP to current PC.
- Treasure donated (e.g. by partying, giving to the poor, offering to religion) gives XP to current and next PC.
- Treasure in the form of magic items donated to NPCs give XP to next PC as 1/10 of their resale value.

1 silver piece = 1 XP.

XP for defeated monsters (not necessarily killed) is divided between the PCs by the players. If an NPC helps the PCs in the fight, the referee negotiates for their share of XP.

XP for written adventures are handed out when the PCs have explored a specificed part of the adventure. The referee decided on how many XP the complete adventure is worth based on length and difficulty, and divides them between different parts of the adventure. In a five level dungeon, the PCs may get 500 XP after each level explored. In a five checkpoint linear adventure, the PCs may get 500 XP at each checkpoint. Adventure XP is individual, and is not divided between multiple characters. The player must be present for their PC to get adventure XP.
